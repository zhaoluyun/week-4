    /* =====================
    # Lab 1, Part 2 — Underscore Each Function

    ## Introduction

    Up to this point, we have used Javascript's for loop to loop through data. Underscore's _.each function provides us with an easy to read, simple way to accomplish the same goal.

    ## Task

    Find two previous labs that use for loops. Rewrite these labs to use _.each.
